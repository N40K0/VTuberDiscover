# VtuberDiscover

This is a tool I created to help the vtuber community find vtubers using an image they have available

The source code for the AI isn't included in this repository because the code structure is *terrible* and some people say it's hard to read, so I decided to not upload the code for the AI.

# How to use

Go to this [site](https://n40k0.github.io/VTuberDiscover/), upload the image of the vtuber you want to find, crop the image for better results.

# Troubleshooting

### 1.  This is not the VTuber in this image

You can create an issue about it [here](https://github.com/N40K0/VtuberDiscover/issues), please include your image in your post so that people who know the VTuber can give you an answer regarding to them.

It's possible that the VTubers are not in the database yet so they will be added at some point in the future.

### 2. I want you to add this VTuber to the database

Sure, you can help me as simple as providing a source about the VTuber such as a link to their youtube or twitch, or if you have a little free time you can create a data set in the form of portrait images focused on them.
